app-js
======
app.js helps you organize your JavaScript files by scoping everything in one object and providing easy acces to commonly used elements like window, document, body, etc.

Set it up like this:

    app = new _app();
    
    jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
    	app.ready();
    });

## How to use
Let's say you want to add a popup modal feature to your app. You could do it this way:
  
    app.modal = function(){
      var self = this;
      
      self.open = function(){
        // Code to open modal here
        app.trigger('modal-open');
      }
      
      self.close = function(){
        // Code to close modal here
        app.trigger('modal-close');
      }
      
      return self;
      
    }
    
Now you have modal functionality and events on your app that tell you when the modal is openeing and closing. Later on you could do this.

    app.ready(function(){
      
      // Open the modal when a user clicks .open-modal element
      $('.open-modal').click(function(){
        app.modal.open();
      })
      
      // Trigger something whenever the modal is opened
      app.on('modal-open', function(){
        alert('Modal was opened!');
      })
      
    })
